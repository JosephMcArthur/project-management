# Project Based Planning and Delivery Process

Goal: improve delivery, clarity and confidence in your work

What: a project-oriented process for delivering using agile, iterative methods

2 key aspects

* Project-oriented: most work takes place inside a project
* Agile-iterative methods: an approach and set of principles that structure our work

## What is a Project

We seek only "good enough" definition. The aim is to have a definition sufficient for us to "move the ball down the field" not handle every edge case.

A project:

* Is time-delimited
* Is estimatable and estimated
* Has outcomes (goals) and specific, measurable outputs (deliverables) 

FAQs

* A project is not (simply) an ongoing activity or function
  * Example: “Run the International Council” is not a project (not time-delimited). However, this would be a project: establish governance structure and run first IC meeting with X attendees in next 2 months
* Size and time extent can be variable. A project should be more than one single task (e.g. Have Q1 International Council Call is not a project) and would usually last at least 2+ iterations (4 weeks).
  * Projects can involve just one person but prefer projects that require the resource of more than 1 FTE
  * Note: want things that are relatively limited in extent – so e.g. completable in 1-4m with max 3 FTE working on it.

## Delivery

Two aspects to delivery at the business level:

* Project Selection: identifying which projects to take on (involves estimating value and approx cost)
* Project Delivery: execution of the selected projects

## Project Selection

* Project Summary
  * Title (short descriptive sentence)
  * [Optional]: Longer paragraph
  * Outcomes and (measurable) Outputs (with identified beneficiaries)
    * Outputs are (easily) measurable (SMART if possible)
    * Can be classified as: Expect to see, Hope to see, Like to see
  * (Rough) Estimate (person time (+ skills) and other resources) [don’t add when proposing project]
    * (?) Dependencies (e.g. on external resources)
* Business Value [estimated by product owner]
  * Value of the project in delivering on the mission
* Key user stories
  * [Optional] First pass guesstimates of subtasks / user stories
* [Optional] Dependencies on other units
* Project Backlog - prioritized list of projects
* Super Product Owner - overall decision maker on project priority in the backlog

How does escalation happen and the generation of new projects?

* Escalation e.g. if the current total project estimate has changed substantially (e.g. by more than 20%) then this should be flagged to the SPO (likely at the end of the sprint)
* As Projects end new projects will need to be activated. This need should be flagged to the SPO and they will ensure there is a good prioritized backlog. Some consultation may need to be done to check the next up project aligns with the team available.
* New projects can be proposed at any time. However, as estimation is involved, we may try to coordinate this. This will likely be driven either by the project backlog running low and/or new opportunities arising.
